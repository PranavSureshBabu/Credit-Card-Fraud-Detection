Situation
With the growing volume of online transactions, detecting fraudulent credit card activity has become a major challenge in the financial industry. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to catch complex patterns of fraud, prompting the need for more intelligent, data-driven solutions.

Task
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. The objective was to test and compare different models, optimize their performance, and address the class imbalance inherent in fraud detection.

Analysis
The dataset used included anonymized features (V1â€“V28), along with Amount, Time, and a Class label (0 for normal and 1 for fraud).

The data was highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions comprising a very small fraction of the total.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand distributions and detect correlations.

Data preprocessing included:

Scaling the Amount feature using StandardScaler.

Splitting the data into training and test sets.

Applying SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the training data.

Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.

Results
Logistic Regression provided a good baseline but struggled with recall due to class imbalance.

Random Forest Classifier delivered the best overall performance with high recall and precision, making it more suitable for identifying fraudulent transactions.

Applying SMOTE significantly improved the model's ability to detect fraud by addressing the class imbalance.

The best-performing model achieved strong metrics across the board, particularly in recall, which is crucial for fraud detection use cases.
